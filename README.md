## Introduction
During the following discussion, we will introduce "the cooperative principle".
In social science generally and linguistics specifically, the cooperative principle describes how effective communication in conversation is achieved in common social situations, that is, how listeners and speakers must act cooperatively and mutually accept one another to be understood in a particular way. As phrased by **Paul Grice**, a British philosopher of language who introduced it, "Make your contribution such as it is required, at the stage at which it occurs, by the accepted purpose or direction of the talk exchange in which you are engaged." Though phrased as a prescriptive command, the principle is intended as a description of how people normally behave in conversation.

## Why we should obey
Those who obey the cooperative principle in their language use will make sure that what they say in a conversation furthers the purpose of that conversation. Obviously, the requirements of different types of conversations will be different.

The cooperative principle goes both ways: speakers _generally_ observe the cooperative principle, and listeners _generally_ assume that speakers are observing it. This allows for the possibility of implicatures, which are meanings that are not explicitly conveyed in what is said, but that can nonetheless be inferred. 

## Four Maxim's
### Introduction
The cooperative principle can be divided into four maxims, called the Gricean Maxims, describing specific rational principles observed by people who obey the cooperative principle; these principles enable effective communication. Grice proposed four conversational maxims that arise from the pragmatics of natural language. Applying the Gricean Maxims is a way to explain the link between utterances and what is understood from them.

### Maxim of Quality
#### Summary
1. Do not say what you believe to be false.
2. Do not say that for which you lack adequate evidence.

#### Examples
1. Combs
> Guess whether the comb in my hand is red or green. If you are right i'll give my pretty blue comb to you.

    This is a matter of presupposition, and I categorize it in this part. That's because what you say convinces the other speaker the comb is red or green, but actually neither.
	
2. London in USA
> S:Is Bangkok in India?
> 
> T:yes, just as London is in america
	
    I think everyone knows what the previous example means, but it is just a joke when you see from outside, or you are habing a meta-view. Now think as if you are the student in the dialog. You must be confused because the teacher tell you that London is in america, but you know that it's in Britain. this contradicts to the rule and finally the student still doesnt know whether bangkok is in india.

### Maxim of Quantity
- Make your contribution as informative as is required (for the current purposes of the exchange).
- Do not make your contribution more informative than is required.

#### The understanding of maxim of quantity
Complex activities, by definition, contain a large amount of detail.  When people describe activities to one another they leave out information they feel is unimportant and emphasize information they feel is essential.

#### Example of the maxim of quantity
1. giving less information
> Monica: Hey. It’s him. (On the intercom) Who is it?
> 
> Alan: (on the intercom) It’s Alan. 
> 
> Joey : (shouting to Chandler) Chandler! He’s here! 
>
> Monica: (to all ) Ok, please be good, please. Just remember how much you all like 
me . 
>
> (She opens the door and Alan enters.) 
>
> Monica: Hi, Alan, this is …everybody .Everybody, this is Alan. 
>
> Alan: Hi . 
>
> All: Hi, Alan. (Friends, 1995) 

  Instead of introducing her five friends one by one, Monica just uses one word 
“everyone” to represent five friends when she introduces them to her new boyfriend 
Alan. She, obviously, is withholding some of the information required at this stage of 
conversation and is thus flouting the maxim of Quantity. The introduction is in 
contrast to everyone's nervousness before seeing Alan. **In this case, humor occurs 
gently.** Monica's implied message known in the following plot is “Alan has heard so 
much about them, do not have to introduce them one by one.”

2. giving more information
> Owen: Hello. Are you in the dormitory? Can you bring my book to the second teaching building.I forget to take it with me this morning. How careless I am! It’s on my table,right under a series books.Maybe under the computer or on the shelf.It’s my English book,the bule one,not the green one.
>
> Bob: What?

  In terms of quantity of information, what Owen need to say to Bob is as follow: help him find his English book in the dormitory. That is enough. But Owen provides a quantity of redundant information,just making it more unclear.

#### Conclusion 
Quantity is a very important principle of the cooperative principles. And it is widely used in our daily life. On one hand, in our daily conversation, we should give enough information to the listener according to this principle. If we do so, the listener can easily get the information they need and we can avoid many unnecessary misunderstandings and troubles. As a result, our communication will be very pleasant. On the other hand, in some of our conversations, if there is some information what we don't want to give to the listener, then we can violate the quantity principle appropriately. Because we still obey the cooperative principle by giving little information. Besides, we also save the listener's face at the same time. In a word, it will be very useful if we can make good use of the quantity principle. And the quantity principle is a good strategy of communication.

### Maxim of Relevance
- Be Relevant
With respect to this maxim, Grice writes, "Though the maxim itself is terse, its formulation conceals a number of problems that exercise me a good deal: questions about what different kinds and focuses of relevance there may be, how these shift in the course of a talk exchange, how to allow for the fact that subjects of conversations are legitimately changed, and so on. I find the treatment of such questions exceedingly difficult, and I hope to revert to them in later work."

#### Examples
Simply, it would not make sense to reply to a question about the weather with an answer about groceries.

Another example, like this:
> A: have you gone to see the move last night? I was so busy that time that I missed it.
>
> B: Yes, it is pretty good!
>
> A: It must be! Can you tell me the main line of the film?
>
> B: Oh, I still remember how handsome the chief actor was! And words fail me to describe his wonderful acting skills! …
>
> A: I want to know how the story is unfolded …
>
> B: the special effects were also unexpected! …
>
> C: OK, stop please! What you said lack relevance!

But the lack of relevance may convey other information instead of literal meaning.
Flouting Relation  
> A:  (Letter of Recommendation) What qualities does John have for this position?   
>
> B:  John has nice handwriting.     +> John is not qualified for the job  
>
> b. A:  Susan can be such a cow sometimes!   
>
> B:  Lovely weather, isn’t it?     +> B finds A’s comment inappropriate (for some reason or other)

  Relation Implicatures  a. Pass the salt   +> Pass the salt now  b. A: Can you tell me the time?   B: Well, the milkman has come    +> The time now is after the time the milkman arrived 
 
  In this example, the utterance is in the imperative so it has no contrast between present and past tense. The speaker has made a request but has not signaled when he wishes the salt. On a literal level, the speaker is not observing the maxim of relation but the addressee assumes that on a deeper level he is. The addressee infers that the request is relates to the here and now. The implicature is therefore pass the salt now. In (16b), A asks the time. B’s reply is not literally relevant to the question. A assumes be is cooperating and being relevant. A infers that B is relating the time at which the milkman came to the current time. The implicature is thus that the time now is after the time the milkman arrived. [Please don’t assume this is the only implicature—there is nothing to prevent one utterance from resulting in several implicatures.]   Lastly, manner implicatures have to do with the form of the utterance. The maxim of manner requires that an utterance be perspicuous. When the speaker does not observe this maxim, his utterance is obscure or ambiguous or disorderly and this is intended to convey an implicit meaning. 

### Maxim of Manner
The last maxim is not about the content, but about the way we communicate. As Paul Grice pointed out, the conversation should be perspicacious. More specifically, we should avoid obscurity of expression, avoid ambiguity, be brief, and be orderly.

#### Explanation
"Be perspicacious" requires both communicators to convey their intentions with a clear use of syntax and phonology of the language. The supermaxim has four sub-points.
##### Avoid obscurity of expression
##### Avoid ambiguity
That is avoid using words that have two meanings but its meaning cannot be inferred from the context.
##### Be brief
We should directly convey messages, avoiding unnecessary prolixity.
##### Be orderly
We should tell things in logical or chronological order, so that the listener can rebuild the message very easily.

#### Examples
##### Stick on myself
> A: Here’s your five-cent stamp.
>
> B, with arms full of bundles: Do I have to stick it on myself?
>
> A: Nope. On the envelope.

So this a very good exmaple showing how ambiguity teases both of the communicators. By asking A whether he/she needs to stick th stamp on by himself/herself, B intends to make A help him/her do that. Unfortunately, A misunderstood his/her words, so A replies that B has no trouble to stick the stamp on the body.

##### Asking for locations
> A: Where is the nearest subway station?
>
> B. Latitude 39 degrees, 59 minutes, 23 seconds, longitude 116 degrees, 18 minutes, 34 seconds, elevation 43 feet above sea level, door faces 14 degrees east of due south.
>
> A. Thanks a bunch, I'll go right there. Just let me get out my GPS device.

B has told the very precise location, but it is quite clear that the information is useless if there no GPS device at hand.

##### Another exmaple
> A: Our local cinema will be displaying a series of still images featuring a costly CGI tonight.
>
> B: Do you mean there is an exciting film with a fantasy movie effects on release?

How to briefly convey that there is a very good movie. Maybe A is not interested in watching films.


## Flouting the maxims
Without cooperation, human interaction would be far more difficult and counterproductive. Therefore, the Cooperative Principle and the Gricean Maxims are not specific to conversation but to verbal interactions in general. For example, it would not make sense to reply to a question about the weather with an answer about groceries because it would violate the Maxim of Relevance. Likewise, responding to a simple yes/no question with a long monologue would violate the Maxim of Quantity.

However, it is possible to flout a maxim intentionally or unconsciously and thereby convey a different meaning than what is literally spoken. As we have shown in the examples before, many times in conversation, this flouting is manipulated by a speaker to produce a negative pragmatic effect, as with sarcasm or irony.
